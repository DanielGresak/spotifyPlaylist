# spotifyPlaylist

This was made during The App Brewerys 100 days of python. I thought it was a cool idea and relatively simple to implement. 
I enjoyed learning how to web scrape and  using that information through spotifys api.

### Current Issues
Some issues are out of my control such as the songs not being available on spotify. Another small issue is I need 
to figure out how to search more than one term (e.g. artist: variable, song: Other variable). My friend Stephen helped 
me refactor the code into functions and also taught me some better practices. Sometimes the songs that are inserted aren't the correct ones. 
I'm not sure if this will still be an issue once I can search more than one term.

- [ ] Search more than one term
- [ ] Incorrect songs being added

### Libraries and Apis used

For this I used BeautifulSoup to do the web scraping and Spotipy with the Spotify api to create and add to the playlist. 
I also used libraries os, pathlib and dotenv to hide api authentication details.
